## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by emailing us at **security@tensor.so**. 

### Guidelines for Reporting:
- Please provide as much detail as possible, including a POC/steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Allow us a reasonable timeframe to respond and address the issue before making any disclosures.
- Do not publicly disclose the issue until we have confirmed a fix.
